<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Jordan and I'm from Portsmouth. <br/> I grew up loving computers, and always loving how to figure
  things out, like puzzles or broken electronics, all sorts.<br />
  I don't believe school was right for me, and how the education system was then, did not fit my learning style at all. <br/> 
  So now I've learnt to teach myself. Everything from guitar, Ableton Live, to synthesis, to photoshop, to premier pro, <br/> 
  to Unreal Engine, and now HTML, CSS and Javascript. <br />
  It's been an interesting journey.
